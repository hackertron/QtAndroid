# bottom_nav_x
Sample APP - Qt 5.7+ - Android iOS

[AUTHOR ( ekke )](AUTHOR.md)

This app is part of ekke's blog series about mobile x-platform development:
http://j.mp/qt-x

This is not a real-life app - this app only demonstrates the use of Material style and new Qt Quick Controls 2

This app is a follow-up to
* blog http://j.mp/qt-one-page-x (first app with Qt Quick Controls 2)
* blog http://bit.ly/qt-stacked-pages-x (StackView)
* blog http://bit.ly/qt-swiped-pages-x (SwipeView)
* blog http://bit.ly/qt-tab-pages-x (TabBar)
please read these blogs and explroe corresponding apps before going on

The topics of this 5th sample app:

* Navigation with Bottom Navigation Bar
* Navigation with SideBar in Landscape
* Navigation with Shortcut (physical keyboard attached, per ex. BlackBerry PRIV)
* Dark Theme and selecting primary and accent color from options menu in ToolBar
* Lazy instantiation of Pages using Loaders
* Try out different ways to style Navigation Bar

Strings are marked as translatable, but not translated yet. See the first app to learn about i18n.

This 5th sample app is a simple app only to demonstrate navigation through pages via Bottom Navigation.
Bottom Navigation is new to Google Material Style and works great if your app has 3 to 5 areas.
Bottom Navigation also looks great on iOS - esp. the uncolored version
